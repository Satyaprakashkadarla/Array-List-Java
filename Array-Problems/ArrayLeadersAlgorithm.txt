The "leaders in an array" problem involves finding elements in an array that are greater than all elements to their right. In other words, a leader is an element that has no element greater than itself on its right side.

Here's a simple algorithm to find the leaders in an array:

1.Start from the rightmost element of the array and initialize the maximum element encountered so far as the rightmost element.

2.Traverse the array from right to left.

3.For each element encountered:
a. If the current element is greater than the maximum element encountered so far, then:-

i. Update the maximum element encountered so far to the current element.

ii. Add the current element to the list of leaders.

4.Finally, reverse the list of leaders (if needed) since we found them while traversing the array from right to left.


Here is a Python implementation of the above algorithm:

def find_leaders(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    leaders = []
    max_right = arr[n - 1]  # Initialize the maximum element encountered so far

    # Traverse the array from right to left
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] > max_right:
            max_right = arr[i]
            leaders.append(max_right)

    # Reverse the list of leaders to get them in correct order
    leaders.reverse()
    return leaders

# Example usage:
arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
print("Leaders in the array:", find_leaders(arr))

/*This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) since it only requires a single traversal of the array.
