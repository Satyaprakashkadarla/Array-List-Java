Here's the algorithm for left rotating an array by one position:

Algorithm: Left Rotate Array by One

Input: Array arr of length n

1. Store the first element of the array in a variable temp.
2. Iterate through the array from index 1 to n-1:
      a. Set arr[i-1] equal to arr[i].
3. Place the value stored in temp at the last index of the array.
4. Return the modified array.
