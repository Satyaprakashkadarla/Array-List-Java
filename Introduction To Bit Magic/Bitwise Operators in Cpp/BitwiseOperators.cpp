Bitwise operators in C++ are operators that manipulate individual bits of operands. They are often used in low-level programming, embedded systems, and optimization tasks where you need to work at a very granular level with data. Here's a brief overview of bitwise operators in C++:

1.Bitwise AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is 1 if both bits are 1, otherwise 0.

cpp code
int result = a & b;
