function tailRecursiveFactorial(n, acc)
    if n == 0 then
        return acc
    else
        return tailRecursiveFactorial(n - 1, acc * n)

# Example usage
result = tailRecursiveFactorial(5, 1)
In this pseudocode:

n represents the number for which we want to calculate the factorial.
acc represents the accumulator, which keeps track of the partial result of the factorial calculation.
We start with acc initialized to 1, as the factorial of 0 is 1.
The function calls itself recursively with n-1 and acc * n until n reaches 0.
When n becomes 0, the function returns the accumulated result.
