Algorithm: sum_of_natural_numbers(n)
Input: An integer n
Output: The sum of natural numbers from 1 to n

1. if n is less than or equal to 1, return n.
2. Otherwise,
   a. Calculate the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n-1 recursively.
   b. Add n to the sum obtained from step 2a.
   c. Return the sum.

Example Usage:
number = 5
result = sum_of_natural_numbers(number)
Print "The sum of natural numbers up to", number, "is:", result
