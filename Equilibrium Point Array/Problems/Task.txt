Equilibrium Index: Find the equilibrium index in an array where the sum of elements to the left is equal to the sum of elements to the right.
Count Equilibrium Indexes: Find the number of equilibrium indexes in an array.
Maximum Equilibrium Sum: Find the maximum sum of elements for which both sides of the array are balanced.
Smallest Positive Equilibrium Index: Find the smallest positive equilibrium index in an array.
Largest Equilibrium Subarray: Find the largest subarray in an array which is an equilibrium array.
Partition Array into Equilibrium Subarrays: Partition an array into minimum number of subarrays such that each subarray is an equilibrium array.
Equilibrium Point with Minimum Sum: Find the equilibrium index in an array such that the sum of absolute differences of elements on both sides is minimized.
Equilibrium Subsequence: Find the longest subsequence in an array which forms an equilibrium array.
Minimum Insertions to Make Array Equilibrium: Find the minimum number of insertions required to make an array an equilibrium array.
Equilibrium Pairs: Find all pairs of indices (i, j) in an array such that the sum of elements from index i to index j is equal to the sum of elements from index j+1 to index n-1.
