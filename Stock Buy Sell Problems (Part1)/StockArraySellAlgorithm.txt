Here's a more detailed algorithm for the "Stock Buy Sell" problem:

Algorithm:

1.Start from the first price and iterate through each subsequent price in the array.
2.Keep track of the minimum price seen so far (minPrice) and the maximum profit (maxProfit).
3.For each price, calculate the potential profit if the stock is sold at that price by subtracting the minPrice from the current price.
4.If this potential profit is greater than the current maxProfit, update maxProfit accordingly.
5.If the current price is lower than minPrice, update minPrice to the current price.
6.After iterating through all prices, return maxProfit as the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling a stock at most once.

Here's the pseudocode corresponding to the algorithm:

function maxProfit(prices):
    minPrice = infinity
    maxProfit = 0
    for each price in prices:
        // Check if the current price could result in a higher profit
        if price - minPrice > maxProfit:
            maxProfit = price - minPrice
        // Update the minimum price seen so far
        if price < minPrice:
            minPrice = price
    return maxProfit

//This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling a stock at most once. It traverses the prices array only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of prices in the array
