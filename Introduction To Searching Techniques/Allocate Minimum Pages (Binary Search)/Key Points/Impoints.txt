Key Points about Allocating Minimum Pages Using Binary Search
Problem Overview
Objective: Allocate n books to m students such that the maximum number of pages allocated to any student is minimized.
Constraints: Each student must get at least one book, and every book must be allocated to a student.
Key Concepts
Binary Search: The solution uses binary search to efficiently determine the minimum possible value of the maximum pages any student can get.
Feasibility Check: A helper function (isPossible or equivalent) checks if a given maximum pages limit (mid) is feasible by simulating the allocation process.
Steps to Solve
Initial Checks:

If the number of students (m) is greater than the number of books (n), it is impossible to allocate, so return -1.
Binary Search Setup:

Low Bound: Set to the maximum number of pages in a single book. This ensures no student gets fewer pages than the largest book.
High Bound: Set to the sum of all pages. This represents the scenario where one student could potentially get all the books.
Binary Search Execution:

Compute the middle value (mid) between low and high.
Use the feasibility function to check if the books can be allocated such that no student gets more than mid pages.
Adjust the bounds based on the feasibility check:
If feasible, adjust high to mid - 1 to search for a smaller maximum.
If not feasible, adjust low to mid + 1 to search for a larger maximum.
Feasibility Function:

Traverse through the books and allocate them to students while ensuring the total pages per student do not exceed mid.
If adding a book exceeds mid, allocate to the next student.
Return false if more than m students are needed, otherwise return true.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: The binary search runs in O(log(sum(arr) - max(arr))), and the feasibility check runs in O(n). Thus, the overall complexity is O(n log(sum(arr) - max(arr))).
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space beyond the input array.
Practical Applications
Educational Resource Allocation: Allocating study materials or books to students to ensure balanced workloads.
Project Distribution: Assigning projects or tasks among employees or teams to balance workloads.
Load Balancing: Distributing workloads in computer systems to minimize the maximum load on any single processor.
Considerations
Ensure the array of books and number of students are appropriately validated before attempting the allocation.
Handle edge cases where the number of students exceeds the number of books.
By understanding these points, you can effectively implement and apply the algorithm for minimizing the maximum number of pages allocated to any student, ensuring an optimal and balanced distribution of resources.
