Start from the first element of the array.
Compare each element with the next one.
If the current element is greater than the next one, return False indicating that the array is not sorted.
If all elements are checked without finding any out-of-order pairs, return True, indicating that the array is sorted.
Here's the algorithm expressed more formally:


Algorithm: isSorted(arr)

Input: An array arr of n elements.

Output: True if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, False otherwise.

1. Initialize a variable i to 0.
2. Repeat steps 3 and 4 while i is less than n-1:
      3. If arr[i] is greater than arr[i+1], return False.
      4. Increment i by 1.
5. Return True.
