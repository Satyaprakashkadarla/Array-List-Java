Function minConsecutiveFlips(array):
    flipCount = 0
    current = array[0]
    
    for i from 1 to n-1:
        if array[i] != current:
            flipCount++
            current = array[i]
    
    return flipCount


Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(n) - The algorithm traverses through the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.
