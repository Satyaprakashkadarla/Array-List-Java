The maximum appearing element algorithm is used to find the element that appears the maximum number of times in a given range of intervals.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1.Create an array to store the occurrences of elements.
2.Iterate through each interval and increment the count of elements within that interval.
3.Find the element with the maximum count of occurrences.

Here's a Python implementation of the algorithm:

def max_appearing_element(intervals):
    count = [0] * 1000000

    for start, end in intervals:
        count[start] += 1
        count[end] -= 1

    max_count = 0
    max_element = 0
    current_count = 0

    for i in range(len(count)):
        current_count += count[i]
        if current_count > max_count:
            max_count = current_count
            max_element = i

    return max_element

# Example usage:
intervals = [(1, 3), (2, 5), (9, 12), (5, 8)]
print("Maximum appearing element:", max_appearing_element(intervals))
