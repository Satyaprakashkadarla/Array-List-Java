The Josephus problem is a theoretical problem with various applications in computer science and mathematics. It goes like this:

Suppose there are n people standing in a circle and a decision is made to eliminate every k-th person from the circle, going around clockwise, until only one person remains. The task is to find out the position of the last person remaining.
def josephus(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return (josephus(n - 1, k) + k) % n

# Example usage
n = 7  # number of people
k = 3  # every 3rd person is eliminated
position = josephus(n, k)
print("The last person remaining is at position:", position + 1)
In this algorithm, n represents the number of people initially standing in the circle, and k represents the count of people to be skipped before eliminating the next person. The function josephus(n, k) returns the position of the last person remaining after the elimination process.

The formula (josephus(n - 1, k) + k) % n is used to compute the position of the survivor based on the positions of the survivors in smaller circles.

Here's how it works:

If there's only one person left (n == 1), that person will be at position 0 (indexing starting from 0).
Otherwise, the position of the survivor in the current circle can be calculated by adding k to the position of the survivor in the circle with n-1 people, then taking modulo n.
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of people in the circle.
