Procedure PrintNumbers(n)
    If n is greater than 0 then
        Output n
        Call PrintNumbers(n - 1)
    End If
End Procedure
This pseudocode defines a procedure PrintNumbers that takes an integer n as input. It checks if n is greater than 0. If n is greater than 0, it prints the value of n, then calls itself recursively with n-1. This process continues until n becomes 0 or negative, at which point the recursion stops.
