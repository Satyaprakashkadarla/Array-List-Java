Initialize the Gray Code list with 0 as the first element.
Loop for i from 1 to 2^n - 1:
Add (i XOR (i >> 1)) to the Gray Code list.
def gray_code(n):
    gray = [0]  # Start with 0 as the first element
    for i in range(1, 1 << n):  # Iterate from 1 to 2^n - 1
        gray.append(i ^ (i >> 1))  # Add the XOR result to the list
    return gray

# Example usage:
n = 3  # Number of bits
print("Gray Code for", n, "bits:", gray_code(n))
