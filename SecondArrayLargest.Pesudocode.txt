//Here's a simple algorithm to find the second largest element in an array using pseudocode:

Function findSecondLargest(arr):
    // Initialize variables to store the largest and second largest elements
    largest = arr[0]
    secondLargest = arr[1]
    
    // Ensure that largest and secondLargest are initialized properly
    if largest < secondLargest:
        largest, secondLargest = secondLargest, largest
    
    // Iterate through the array starting from the third element
    for i from 2 to length(arr) - 1:
        // Update largest and secondLargest accordingly
        if arr[i] > largest:
            secondLargest = largest
            largest = arr[i]
        else if arr[i] > secondLargest and arr[i] â‰  largest:
            secondLargest = arr[i]
    
    // Return the second largest element
    return secondLargest

//This pseudocode demonstrates how to iterate through the array once and update the variables largest and secondLargest accordingly to find the second largest element.
