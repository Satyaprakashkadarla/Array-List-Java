Algorithm:

1.Initialize two pointers, start and end, and set them both to the beginning of the array.

2.Initialize a variable currentSum to 0.

3.Iterate through the array:
a. Add the value at the current end pointer to currentSum.
b. If currentSum is greater than the given sum:
i. Increment start pointer and subtract the value at the new start position from currentSum.
c. If currentSum is equal to the given sum, return the subarray between start and end.
d. Increment end pointer.

4.If no subarray is found, return "Subarray not found".
