here's an algorithm to remove duplicates from a sorted array:

1.Initialize a variable i to 0.

2.Iterate through the array starting from the first element.

3.For each element, compare it with the next element.

4.If the current element is not equal to the next element, increment i and copy the current element to the ith position.

5.Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the end of the array is reached.

6.Return i as the new length of the array.


def remove_duplicates(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Index to keep track of the position where the next non-duplicate element should be placed
    next_non_duplicate = 1
    
    # Start iterating from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # If current element is not equal to the previous element, it's a non-duplicate
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            # Place the non-duplicate at the position next_non_duplicate
            arr[next_non_duplicate] = arr[i]
            # Move the next_non_duplicate index forward
            next_non_duplicate += 1
    
    return next_non_duplicate

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6]
new_length = remove_duplicates(arr)
print("Array with duplicates removed:", arr[:new_length])


'''This algorithm iterates through the sorted array once, keeping track of the index where the next non-duplicate element should be placed. If it encounters a duplicate, it simply skips it. Finally, it returns the length of the array without duplicates, which can be used to slice the array if needed.'''
