max_appearing_element(intervals):
    Initialize an array count of size 1000000 with all elements set to 0
    Iterate through each interval in intervals:
        Increment count[start] by 1
        Decrement count[end] by 1
    Initialize max_count to 0
    Initialize max_element to 0
    Initialize current_count to 0
    Iterate through each element in count:
        Add count[i] to current_count
        If current_count is greater than max_count:
            Set max_count to current_count
            Set max_element to i
    Return max_element
