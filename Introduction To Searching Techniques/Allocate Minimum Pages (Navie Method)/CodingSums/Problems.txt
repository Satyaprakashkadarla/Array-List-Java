Minimum Number of Platforms: Given arrival and departure times of all trains that run on a single track, find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.
Minimum Cost to Cut a Rod: Given a rod of length n and an array of prices for rods of different lengths, find the maximum revenue that can be generated by cutting the rod at different places.
Minimum Number of Coins: Given a value n, find the minimum number of coins required to make change for that value, given an infinite supply of coins of denominations 1, 5, 10, and 25.
Minimum Swaps to Sort an Array: Given an array of integers, find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.
Minimum Number of Jumps: Given an array of integers, find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of the array starting from the first index.
These problems are similar to the Allocate Minimum Pages problem in that they all involve finding the minimum number of something (platforms, coins, swaps, jumps, or pages) to achieve a certain goal. They are all classic problems in computer science and are good practice for developing problem-solving skills.
