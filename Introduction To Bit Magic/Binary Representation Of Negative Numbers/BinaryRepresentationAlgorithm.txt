Representing negative numbers in binary is commonly done using Two's Complement notation. In Two's Complement:

1.For positive numbers, the representation remains the same as regular binary.

2.For negative numbers, you first represent the absolute value in binary, then flip all the bits (0s to 1s and 1s to 0s), and finally add 1 to the result.

int x = -5;
unsigned int y = *(unsigned int*) &x;
printf("%u\n", y); // This will print the unsigned binary representation of -5

In this code:

We cast the integer x as an unsigned integer pointer and dereference it, effectively interpreting the bits of -5 as if it were an unsigned integer.
Then we print the unsigned integer y, which effectively prints the binary representation of -5.
Remember, though, the representation of negative numbers in binary can vary depending on the number of bits being used.
