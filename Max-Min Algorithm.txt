Finding the maximum element in an array:

Algorithm:
1.Initialize a variable max to store the maximum value found so far.
2.Iterate through the array elements.
3.Compare each element with the current maximum value (max).
4.If an element is greater than max, update max with that element.
After iterating through all elements, max will contain the maximum 5.value.
