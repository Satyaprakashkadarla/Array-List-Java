Initialize a variable result to 0.
Iterate through each element in the array.
For each element, perform an XOR operation with result.
Return the value of result after all iterations.
Explanation:

Since XOR of a number with itself is 0, and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself, all paired elements will cancel each other out leaving only the single element which occurs once.
def find_single_element(nums):
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result

# Example usage:
arr = [4, 3, 6, 2, 2, 3, 4]
print(find_single_element(arr))  # Output: 6
