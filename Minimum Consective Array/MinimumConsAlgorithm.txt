Algorithm:

1.Initialize a variable flipCount to track the number of flips required.
2.Initialize current to the first element of the array.
3.Traverse through the array:
If the current element is different from current, it means a flip is needed. Increment flipCount and update current to the current element.
4.At the end of the traversal, flipCount will represent the minimum number of consecutive flips required.
