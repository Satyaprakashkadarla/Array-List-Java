//Certainly! Here's the C++ code with comments explaining each step:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxCount = 0; // Initialize variable to store maximum consecutive 1s
    int currentCount = 0; // Initialize variable to store current consecutive 1s
    
    // Iterate through the array
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 1) { // If the current element is 1
            currentCount++; // Increment the count of consecutive 1s
        } else { // If the current element is not 1 (i.e., it's 0)
            maxCount = max(maxCount, currentCount); // Update maxCount with the maximum consecutive 1s encountered so far
            currentCount = 0; // Reset currentCount to 0 for the next potential consecutive sequence
        }
    }
    
    // Check for the maximum consecutive 1s encountered at the end of the array
    return max(maxCount, currentCount);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1};
    cout << "Maximum consecutive 1s: " << findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums) << endl; // Output: 4
    return 0;
}

//I've added comments to each part of the code to explain its purpose and how it contributes to finding the maximum consecutive 1s in the array.
