Algorithm:

1.Initialize maxProfit to 0.
2.Iterate through each price in the prices array starting from the second price.
3.If the current price is higher than the previous price, add the difference between the current price and the previous price to maxProfit.
4.Repeat step 3 for all prices.
5.Return maxProfit as the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling the stock.

Pseudocode:


function maxProfit(prices):
    maxProfit = 0
    for i from 1 to n-1:
        if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
            maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
    return maxProfit

//This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling a stock at most once by identifying the valleys and peaks in the price graph and calculating the profit accordingly. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of prices in the array, as it iterates through the prices array once.//
