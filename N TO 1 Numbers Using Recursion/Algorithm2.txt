# Example usage:
print_numbers(5)
This algorithm prints numbers from n down to 1 recursively. It starts by checking if n is equal to 0, in which case it returns without printing anything. Otherwise, it prints the current value of n, then calls itself recursively with n-1, continuing until n reaches 0.
