1. Create an empty hash map count_map.
2. Iterate through the elements in the array:
   a. If the element is already in count_map, increment its count.
   b. If the element is not in count_map, add it to count_map with count 1.
3. Create an empty list result.
4. Iterate through the key-value pairs in count_map:
   a. If the count of the element is odd, append the element to result.
5. Return the list result.
