Algorithm reverseArray(arr):
    Input: An array arr of n elements.
    Output: An array containing the elements of arr in reverse order.

    1. Initialize a new array reversedArr of size n.
    2. Initialize a variable j to n - 1.
    3. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each element in arr, starting from the first element:
        4. Set reversedArr[j] to the current element of arr.
        5. Decrement j by 1.
    6. Return reversedArr.


This algorithm creates a new array called reversedArr of the same size as the original array. It then iterates through the original array from the first element to the last, assigning each element to the corresponding position in reversedArr but in reverse order. Finally, it returns the reversed array.
