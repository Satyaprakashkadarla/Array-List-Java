//Here's the algorithm to find the second largest element in an array:


Algorithm findSecondLargest(arr)
    largest = arr[0]  // Initialize largest as the first element
    secondLargest = NULL  // Initialize secondLargest as NULL
    
    for i from 1 to length(arr) - 1 do
        // If current element is greater than largest
        if arr[i] > largest then
            secondLargest = largest  // Update secondLargest
            largest = arr[i]  // Update largest
        // If current element is smaller than largest but greater than secondLargest
        else if arr[i] > secondLargest and arr[i] â‰  largest then
            secondLargest = arr[i]  // Update secondLargest
    
    // Return the second largest element
    return secondLargest


//This algorithm iterates through the array once, updating the largest and secondLargest variables accordingly to find the second largest element in the array.
